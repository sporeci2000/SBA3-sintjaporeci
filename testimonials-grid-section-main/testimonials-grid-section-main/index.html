                  I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,
                  in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

                  " I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a
                  transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
                  for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
                  The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
                  the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "

                  " Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some
                  structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to
                  enroll by a
                  former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum
                  and staff
                  did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile
                  team
                  project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
                  tutorial
                  could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development
                  experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple
                  offers.
                  100% recommend! "
