This project is a solution to the Frontend Mentor Testimonials Grid Section challenge: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7  

I built the layout using Bootstrap 5 for rapid responsive design and utilized custom CSS for styling to match the challenge requirements. The testimonials are displayed as cards, with different background colors and text styles to highlight verified graduates. Special attention was given to vertical alignment and spacing, especially for the taller testimonial (Kira’s card), to maintain a balanced grid look.  

I also implemented media queries to ensure appropriate padding and layout adjustments on smaller screens, making sure the cards stack vertically with adequate spacing and readable content.

The biggest challenge was managing the varying heights of the testimonial cards, especially Kira’s longer testimonial, which caused alignment issues in the grid. To solve this, I applied CSS margin adjustments and Bootstrap’s responsive grid utilities to align the cards properly and keep a clean layout on all screen sizes.

Another challenge was ensuring text inside the cards remained within the boundaries on smaller screens. I addressed this by adding responsive padding and adjusting font sizes for mobile views.
