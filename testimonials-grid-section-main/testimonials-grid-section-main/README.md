This project is a solution to the Frontend Mentor Testimonials Grid Section challenge: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7  

I built the layout using Bootstrap for rapid responsive design and applied custom CSS to style the testimonials cards to closely match the challenge requirements. The testimonials are presented as cards with distinct background colors and text styles to highlight verified graduates. Special attention was given to vertical alignment and spacing, especially for Kira’s longer testimonial, to maintain a balanced and visually appealing grid layout.  

I implemented media queries to ensure proper padding and layout adjustments on smaller screens, so the cards stack vertically with enough spacing and remain easy to read.

One of the main challenges was managing the varying heights of the testimonial cards, particularly Kira’s card, which caused alignment issues within the grid. To address this, I applied CSS margin adjustments and leveraged Bootstrap’s responsive grid utilities to align the cards properly and maintain a clean layout across all screen sizes.

Another challenge was ensuring the text inside the cards stayed within their boundaries on smaller screens. This was solved by adding responsive padding and adjusting font sizes to improve readability on mobile devices.
